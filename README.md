# Crime Data EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
This project contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of crime incident reports, focused on understanding patterns and trends across different districts and years. Using Python and libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, this analysis explores:

- The volume and distribution of crime incidents by district and year

- Heatmaps showing how crime rates change over time

- Visual insights into geographic and temporal crime trends


## Key Techniques Used
- Grouping and aggregating data with pandas

- Visualization with seaborn heatmaps and color palettes

- Data cleaning and transformation for time-series and categorical analysis

## Contents
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with full EDA workflow

- Heatmap visualizations by district and year

- Grouped and summarized crime statistics
